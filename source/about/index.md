When Michael is not focused on work he enjoys spending time with his wife and two sons. Living in the Maryland countryside they enjoy hobbies like kayaking, mountain biking, fishing and the occasional round of golf. Michael's second passion is brewing beer, and would one day enjoy running a brew pub in the future where he can share his brews with a much wider audience.
