In my last article I wrote about my personal experiences getting MichaelArnel.com up and running, in this article i'll discuss using a Static Site Generator (SSG) to build your very own website. Static Site Generators are tools that takes content in format, such as Markdown, and transforms that content into another format, usually HTML and lays out pages of a website so that the look and feel is consistent across the entire site.
